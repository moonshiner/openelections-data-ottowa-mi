county, precinct, office, district, party, candidate, votes

If a county provides a breakdown of voting method (ie, election day vs. absentee), please include those as separate columns.

 The files should go in the 2022 folder in this repository and should have the following filename structure:

20221108__mi__general__{county}__precinct.csv, where county is the lower case version of the county name, with punctuation removed.

If the county file also provides a breakdown of votes by method, include that using the following headers, where applicable:

early_voting, election_day, provisional, mail

If there are other possible vote types, include them, using a lowercase version of the vote type with underscores instead of spaces for the column name.

Include the following offices:

    Registered Voters (if available)
    Ballots Cast (if available)
    Straight Party
    Governor
    Secretary of State
    Attorney General
    U.S. House
    State Senate
    State House

If a county provides precinct results for Write-in candidates, they should be grouped in a single row for each precinct and office with a candidate value of Write-ins.

If a county provides Under Votes or Over Votes, those should be recorded in the same way, with a single row per precinct and office with Over Votes and Under Votes as the candidate values.
